) . \\nbates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . \\nat times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! \\nthis is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . \\nit's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema . \\nthere are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . \\noh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . \\nbut , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . \\nalong with the pig , of course ! \\nanyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . \\nthere's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . \\nhe succeeds , but . . . she \\nknocks the glass over ! \\ni bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! \\nin the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \\\" d'oh ! ! \\\" \\nother nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . \\nwe cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he \\nrealises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut \\nto the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ? \\nok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! \\nboy , do they work ! \\nif a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! \\nof course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \\\" hobbling \\\" ! \\nannie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all . \\ncue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! \\nnasty . \\nit all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! \\nand then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen . \\nshe gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! \\nsheldon isn't in terribly good shape either . \\nif it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable . \\nbut it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . \\nmisery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . \\nthe directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . \\nwonderful stuff . \\n ?

\\\" \\nquestion springs to mind . \\nfrom the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . \\nlee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . \\nall is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . \\ntoo bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here . \\nfrankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour . \\nthere is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . \\nleguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . \\nthe script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . \\nyou'd never guess from his performance . \\nadrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . \\nsorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart . \\nbrody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . \\nsummer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . \\nbut it's also empty , pretentious and boring . \\nlike last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n\",\n          \"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something . \\nit angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up . \\nit ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film . \\nhaving endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about . \\ndoes men live up to its press ? \\nwell , yes it does . \\nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \\nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \\nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \\nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \\nhoward is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \\nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \\nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \\nthe reason ? \\nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \\n \\\" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , \\\" he says . \\nhoward , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan . \\nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \\nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \\nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \\nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \\nyou can guess which one she falls for . \\nsoon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \\nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \\nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \\nhis evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile . \\nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart . \\nhis character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \\nhe's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \\nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \\npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \\nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \\nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe . \\nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \\ncould it happen in the real world ? \\nprobably not . \\ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \\nmaybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \\nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \\nthe marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \\nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \\nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \\nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \\nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \\nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \\nby the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \\ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \\nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \\nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \\nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \\nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pos\",\n          \"neg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
