# Sentiment Analysis and Customer Segmentation

This project was completed under the **CodeClause Internship (Mayâ€“June 2025)**.  
It focuses on **Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**.

## ðŸ§  Project Aim
To apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior, and to use NLP techniques to analyze sentiments in text data.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Feature engineering from textual data
- K-Means clustering algorithm
- Sentiment analysis model development

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb` â€“ main code and results
- `dataset.csv` â€“ input dataset
- `output/` â€“ contains charts, cluster visualizations, etc.

## âœ… Status
âœ… Completed (May 3 â€“ June 3, 2025)
